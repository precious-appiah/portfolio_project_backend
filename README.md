### Motivation
In my quest to deepen my understanding of Python and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in file systems, I embarked on a project to build a To-Do application. The primary inspiration behind this endeavor was to gain hands-on experience with Python and apply it to practical, real-world tasks. Through this project, I aimed to solidify my grasp on basic Python concepts while also mastering CRUD operations.

### About the app
The To-Do application I developed includes several key features that demonstrate my learning journey. First and foremost, I implemented user management, allowing for the creation of new users and user authentication through login functionality. This was a crucial step, as it enabled a personalized experience where tasks are managed on a per-user basis.
Key Features of the To-Do Application

#### User Registration and Login:
The application allows users to create accounts using their email addresses and passwords. This feature ensures that each user has a unique profile, safeguarding their personal tasks. The login functionality authenticates users, granting them access to their specific task lists.
#### Creating Tasks:
Once logged in, users can create tasks. Each task includes a title, description, and status (e.g., pending, in progress, or completed). The tasks are associated with the user's email, ensuring that only the logged-in user can view and manage their tasks.
#### Reading Tasks:
Users can view their list of tasks at any time. This feature displays all tasks associated with the user's profile, providing a comprehensive view of pending, ongoing, and completed tasks.
#### Updating Tasks:
The application allows users to update their tasks. Users can modify the title, description, and status of their tasks, reflecting the current state of their work. This CRUD operation is crucial for maintaining an up-to-date task list.
Deleting Tasks: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed. This feature helps keep the task list organized and relevant, removing any clutter from completed or irrelevant tasks.
